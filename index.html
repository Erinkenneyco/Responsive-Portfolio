                <p> My name is Erin Kenney and I am looking to become a succesful web developer. I have quite the interesting backgorund which most recently includes selling real estate. While I love helping people find and sell homes, I have realized I enjoy working behind the scenes much better. I love inputing data into local MLS systems, creating the marketing behind the campaigns and completing the contracts. I hope to take my web coding skills to the next level and work with a real estate company to develop the best tools for agents to use to improve their everyday efficiency when using web based applications.
                </p>

                <p> I cannot wait to learn more about full-stack development! I am very excited to be a part of a field that will always be growing and changing. I will soon be able to help your company have a complete online presence from front-end to back-end to servers and databases. 

                </p>

                <p> I am a person who loves her family and feels the most grounded when surrounded by the ones I love. I have a five-year-old step-daughter who keeps me on my toes and I enjoy nothing more than watching the wonder in her eyes for every new experience she has.  </p>
